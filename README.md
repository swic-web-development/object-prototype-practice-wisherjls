# JavaScript Objects and Prototypes Practice

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll practice working with JavaScript's powerful object manipulation methods by implementing functions to transform data from the popular video game DOOM.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Make sure you have used the GitHub Classroom link to access this repository. The repository should reflect your GitHub username on the GitHub website. Clone it to your local machine.

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal and run `npm i`.

3. Open the project in VS Code

`code .`.

## Assignment Tasks (30 points total)

The repository contains three files in the `src` directory:

`data.js` - Contains the DOOM monster data
`index.js` - Where you'll implement your solutions
`index.test.js` - Tests that verify your solutions

## Hints

Hints

- Remember that `Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries()` can help you work with nested objects
- Consider using array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` along with object methods
- Pay attention to the structure of the data in `data.js` - you'll need to navigate through multiple levels of nesting
